# GreenHouse

Our greenhouse has four special Feature.

First, it has a feature that checks the temperature and humidity / and then alerts when they are not appropriate. 
We measure temperature and humidity through DHT Sensor and display them periodically on an LCD screen. Additionally, if certain appropriate conditions are not met, a red LED can light up to give a warning.

 Second, it has a function to supply water to plants. We use a water sensor to determine the amount of water in the soil and supply water using a pump when the soil is dry.

Third, it has a function to adjust the amount of sunlight. We detect the amount of light using a photocell. 
We divide it into "Bright", "Average", and "Dark" state, allowing us to adjust the amount of light using a servo motor.

Finally, it has a function to detect insects. When an insect or other object approaches using an ultrasonic distance sensor, we light up yellow LED light that insects dislike.
